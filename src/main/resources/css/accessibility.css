   contrast for better reading. Some need low contrast. 
   A happy medium would be off white to reduce "glare"
   and black text. Anyone that needs a greater extreme
   likely overrides stylesheets.                       
   The text is colored dark blue to assist with "glare"
   issues, but also to make the black symbols subtly stand
   out.                                                  */
